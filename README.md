# project3-web-app

## Used
1.) NodeJS
2.) React
3.) MongoDB/Mongoose
4.) Unity

## Purpose of application
This is a companion app to the Unity game to show a highscore leaderboard for players using the game.  It also has information about the game and instructions on how to play as well as contact information.

## How to use the application
The About page indicates how to play the game. 

## Problems solved
Initially there were problems connecting to Unity to pass the Player Name and Highscore to the database, but that was resolved by researching Unity's documentation on forms and web requests. Once the Unity connection was made, there was quite a bit of testing of the database to ensure it was properly being passed and subsequently displayed using React.
