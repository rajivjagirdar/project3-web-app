# project3-web-app

## Technologies Used
1.) NodeJS
2.) React
3.) MongoDB/Mongoose
4.) Unity

## Purpose of application
This is a companion app to the Unity game to show a highscore leaderboard for players using the game.  It also has information about the game and instructions on how to play as well as contact information.

## How to use the application
The About page indicates how to play the game. 

## Problems solved
Initially there were problems connecting to Unity to pass the Player Name and Highscore to the database, but that was resolved by researching Unity's documentation on forms and web requests. Once the Unity connection was made, there was quite a bit of testing of the database to ensure it was properly being passed and subsequently displayed using React.

## How to Play

The current controls are very simple. WASD or Arrow Keys are used to move. Moving towards an enemy will automatically attack them, if they're in range. By default, the Knight has a range of 1, the Archer has a range of 4, and the Wizard has a range of 2.

Pressing the Escape Key will open the menu. From here you may use special moves, which will cost mana. At the moment, the only special moves are timed buffs.
